Diptish Dey, researcher and lecturer at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, offers insights into his research on the application of the EU AI Act and introduces the strategic model 'APPRAISE' for companies to comply with the law's requirements. According to Dey, the EU AI Act will soon have a significant impact on organizations using AI systems.

### Research on the Application of the EU AI Act

Dey and his team have conducted extensive research on the technical obligations of the EU AI Act and the level of compliance by organizations. Their research has shown that the average compliance with the law is quite low, with only about 55% of organizations meeting the requirements. A concerning insight was that more than 80% of participating organizations were not fully aware of the requirements of the AI Act.

### The APPRAISE Model

The strategic model 'APPRAISE', developed by Dey and his team, helps organizations balance various tensions when innovating with AI systems, including technology, regulations, standardization, and value creation. By understanding and weighing these factors, organizations can create responsible shareholder value. The model provides insights into how technical aspects of AI systems and the AI Act can impose constraints on businesses.

### Practical Approach for Companies

Dey advises companies to understand how AI creates value within their organization and to use the APPRAISE framework to evaluate this value. He emphasizes the importance of technical evaluations of AI systems, especially given the increasing complexity of these systems. An early start with these evaluations is essential to ensure compliance and to prevent systems from becoming too complex for their intended use.

### Future Developments Besides AI

Besides AI, Dey predicts that the growing demand for computing power will drive innovation in hardware for AI systems. He points to the historical relationship between developments in hardware and applications, where growth in one domain drives growth in the other. This development is expected to play a significant role alongside further advancements in AI in the coming years.

With his research and the APPRAISE model, Diptish Dey provides valuable insights and practical strategies for companies to comply with the requirements of the EU AI Act and effectively address the challenges and opportunities in AI governance and innovation.
