Dragoș Tudorache, a liberal Romanian member of the European Parliament and a leading figure in drafting the European Union's incoming Artificial Intelligence Act, advocates for the recruitment of top-tier talent, likening them to "Oppenheimers," to spearhead the enforcement of the legislation. Tudorache argues that the European Commission should prioritize hiring individuals with extensive expertise in AI, including tech workers, academics, and futurists, who possess deep insights into the AI landscape. Drawing parallels to J. Robert Oppenheimer, who assembled a stellar team for the U.S.'s atomic bomb project during World War II, Tudorache emphasizes the critical role of attracting exceptional talent to ensure the successful implementation of the AI Act. 

However, Europe faces stiff competition in the global race for AI experts, with tech companies, government institutes, and other organizations all vying for top talent. The success of the newly established AI Office, responsible for enforcing the groundbreaking AI legislation, hinges on its ability to recruit and retain top-notch professionals. Despite budgetary constraints and competition from other entities, the AI Office is tasked with pivotal responsibilities, such as drafting codes of practice for AI companies, overseeing general-purpose AI models, fostering AI innovation within the EU, and representing European AI diplomacy on the global stage.

As discussions regarding potential leaders for the AI Office ensue, notable candidates such as Lucilla Sioli, Kilian Gross, and Werner Stengg are being considered for the role. Tudorache himself remains a potential candidate, underscoring the importance of appointing a leader well-versed in both the technical aspects of AI and the intricacies of institutional dynamics and AI diplomacy. The recruitment of such talented individuals is crucial for Europe to establish itself as a global leader in responsible AI governance and innovation.
