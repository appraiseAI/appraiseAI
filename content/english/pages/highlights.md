# Research Summary

AI applications are steadily enveloping humans and their environment, with organizations aiming to create value through innovative products and services. This technological progress, however, raises concerns about its impact on fundamental rights, particularly discrimination. To address these issues, the European Commission proposed the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) to safeguard citizens' fundamental rights. The lack of proper enforcement mechanisms in regulations, as observed with the roll-out of GDPR, prompted primary research in the Netherlands. This research involved a survey and validation interviews to understand how organizations intend to comply with the AIA.
